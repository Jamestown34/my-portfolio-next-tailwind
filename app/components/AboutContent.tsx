        A Data Scientist with a background in Pharmaceutical Technology. My journey into data science started
        during my NYSC program at the Ekiti State Ministry of Health, where I became fascinated by the flow of
        data and its potential in decision-making. That experience sparked my curiosity and led me to pursue a
        career in data analytics.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-text2">
        To build my skills, I have taken courses from Coursera, Udemy, and Alex The Analyst, always looking for
        new ways to expand my knowledge. I actively participate in hackathons and engage with data science
        communities, sharpening my ability to uncover trends and make sense of complex data. Predictive
        analytics and machine learning excite me the most because they allow me to turn raw data into valuable insights.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-text2">
        Balancing my background in Pharmaceutical with my enthusiasm for data science keeps me engaged in both
        fields, exploring ways to bridge the gap between business, finance, healthcare, and analytics. Outside of
        work, I have a deep love for history, enjoy movies, and often imagine myself playing the piano.

        My goal is to become a highly skilled data scientist, making an impact in business, tech firms, finance,
        e-commerce, healthcare, and possibly a tech startup by driving data-driven innovation. Feel free to
        check out my projects below, where I share my experiences and insights.
